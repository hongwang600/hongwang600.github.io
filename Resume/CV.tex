\Entry
I am currently working on open-domain question answering and pre-training methods with self-supervised learning. I am also interested in information extraction and reasoning over knowledge graphs (especially for lifelong learning and few-shot learning settings), and low resource Natural Language Processing such as transferring knowledge from rich resource language to other low resource languages.
